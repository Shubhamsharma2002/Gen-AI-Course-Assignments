# Task 03: Python Functions 🛠️

## 📝 Problem Statement
This assignment focuses on building reusable and efficient code modules for an online billing system. The goal is to automate tasks such as calculations and filtering using:
* **User-Defined Functions**: For core logic like discount and price management.
* **Recursive Functions**: To handle mathematical operations like factorials.
* **Lambda, Map, & Filter**: For concise, functional programming approaches to data manipulation.

## 📁 Files in this Folder
* `functions_assignment.ipynb`: Complete solution containing Tasks 1 through 7.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.

## 🚀 Key Features
1. **Reusable Logic**: Functions that handle default arguments and input validation.
2. **Data Processing**: Using `map()` to apply GST to entire lists and `filter()` to categorize products by price.
3. **Interactive Menu**: A modular menu system driven entirely by function calls.


## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. For Task 7, call `run_menu()` to start the interactive terminal interface.
