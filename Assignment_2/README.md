# Task 02: Python Control Flow 🔄

## 📝 Problem Statement
This assignment focuses on mastering **Control Flow** in Python to handle order processing for an e-commerce store. It demonstrates the implementation of logic-driven utilities using:
* **Conditionals (`if/elif/else`)**: For applying business rules and tiered discount logic.
* **Loops (`for` & `while`)**: For processing multiple data points and creating interactive user menus.
* **Loop Control (`break` & `continue`)**: For handling corrupted data and skipping irrelevant entries.

## 📁 Files in this Folder
* `control_flow_assignment.ipynb`: Full solution containing Tasks 1 through 5.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.

## 🚀 Key Features
1. **Dynamic Discounting**: Automatically calculating final amounts based on order value thresholds (15%, 10%, 7%, or 0%).
2. **Interactive User Menu**: A persistent menu system using a `while` loop that allows adding orders and viewing summaries until the user quits.
3. **Data Integrity Handling**: Using `break` to stop processing when corrupted values (-1) are detected and `continue` to skip zero-sale days.



## ⚙️ How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in **Jupyter Notebook** (via Anaconda) or **Google Colab**.
2. Run the cells sequentially to see the interactive menu and discount processing outputs.
